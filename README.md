# Airlines Booking System using C++

This Ticket Booking System is a console-based C++ application designed to simulate an airline ticket booking system. It allows users to register their details, book flights to various destinations, and generate tickets. The system features a user-friendly menu interface, making it simple to navigate between functionalities like customer registration, flight booking, and ticket generation. 

The program provides flight options to six major destinations: Dubai, Canada, UK, USA, Australia, and Europe. Each destination offers multiple flights with detailed information, including flight numbers, departure times, durations, and costs. Users can select a flight, and the system calculates and stores the ticket charges dynamically. Once a booking is complete, the system generates a ticket containing all relevant customer and flight details, which is saved to a text file for persistent storage.

The application utilizes several key programming concepts, such as classes and dynamic memory allocation. It implements a linked list to manage and store booked ticket IDs efficiently. Core classes like 'Details', 'Registration', and 'Ticket' handle different functionalities, including customer data management, flight registration, and ticket generation. The use of file handling ensures that tickets are stored and can be retrieved or displayed as needed.

This project serves as a foundational example of how to design and implement a basic airline booking system. It is a great demonstration of object-oriented programming, file handling, and menu-driven interfaces in C++. Future enhancements could include adding more destinations, seat selection features, and integrating a database or GUI for a more robust system.
